<p><strong>NodeCopter.js is a full day event where teams of 3 get together to hack on flying robots using javascript.</strong> NodeCopter Lounge is the more relaxed variant of  NodeCopter.js which is conducted during a conference, in this case <a href="http://cascadiajs.com/">CascadiaJS</a>.</p>

<p>Professional NodeCopter engineers will be available throughout the two days of the conference in the lounge area along with a handful of <a href="http://ardrone2.parrot.com/">Parrot AR Drone 2.0</a>. The engineers are there to help you program and play with the drones. If a team can be formed, they will be given until the end of each day to accomplish something amazing and present their work to the other attendees.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/voodootikigod">Chris Williams</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mattpodwysocki">Matt Podwysocki</a>, who wrote the <a href="https://github.com/voodootikigod/wii-drone">wii-drone library</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rwldrn">Rick Waldron</a> (author of <a href="https://github.com/rwldrn/johnny-five">Johnny-Five</a>) and <a href="https://github.com/nexxy">Emily Rose</a> (author of <a href="https://github.com/nexxy">many epic Hardware Hacking</a>) will be present to lend support and advice.</p>

<p><strong>But, but, hardware hacking is hard...</strong></p>

<p>Sure, but the Node community has abstracted all that difficulty away.  If you want to write JavaScript to control an AR Drone, here&#39;s the little bit of code you need to get Node.js to control it for you:</p>

<pre><code>var arDrone = require(&#39;ar-drone&#39;);
var client = arDrone.createClient();

client.takeoff();

client
  .after(5000, function() {
    this.clockwise(0.5);
  })
  .after(3000, function() {
    this.stop();
    this.land();
  });</code></pre>

<p>Yeah, that&#39;s it. Still afraid of hardware? There&#39;s tons more you can do - hookup a browser using Socket.IO to the Node server so you can use your browser to control the drone.  Or capture a live stream of image data from the drone, drop it in to a canvas (either on the server or client side) and do some image processing (like facial recognition, pixel searching, etc).  </p>

<p>If you can write JavaScript, then you can fly these bad boys, but moreover, you&#39;ve got the tools to hack these drones to do what ever crazy idea you come up with.</p>

<p><strong>Awesome, Where Do I Sign Up?</strong></p>

<p>Unlike the bigger NodeCopter.js events, the lounge events are designed to attract passerby interest during a conference (in this case <a href="http://cascadiajs.com/">CascadiaJS</a>) and let you try out the NodeCopters before attending the full-fledged hackathon event. There will be many different projects being shown and constructed during the conference time so stop by at any point. If a group of no more than three find a project they want to pursue, they will be given a dedicated copter to develop with. In total, the goal is to have fun... WITH FLYING ROBOTS!</p>

<p>The NodeCopter Lounge will be open during the normal hours of CascadiaJS and do require a CascadiaJS Attendee Ticket to participate, but nothing further.</p>

<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>

<p>During the Nodecopter Dublin event very recently, Felix Geisendörfer wrote a library to control the Parrot AR Drone 2.0 with javascript using node.js. He also just wrote a <a href="https://github.com/felixge/node-cross-compiler">tool to install node.js ON THE DRONE</a>.</p>

<p>At the beginning of October, he and Berlin.js held the first Nodecopter event, with 20 teams hacking on everything from controlling drones with Wii controllers, to programming their drones to see red and charge. <a href="http://www.mikealrogers.com/posts/hella-copters.html">Read Mikeal Rogers&#39;s blog post for a full report</a>.</p>
