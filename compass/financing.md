As you have seen in the [example budget](/compass/budget#example), putting on
a nodecopter event will typically cost **2500 - 10000 USD**.

We are actively working on bringing these costs down by creating a base stock
of drones in North America and Europe, but for now, here is how you can raise
money for your event:

* [Selling Tickets](#selling-tickets)
* [Finding Sponsors](#finding-sponsors)

Additionally you can lower the costs of your event by:

* [Using Existing Drones](#using-existing-drones)
* [Negotiating Discounts](#negotiating-discounts)
