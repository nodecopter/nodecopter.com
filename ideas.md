First off, please check out the many [modules](http://nodecopter.com/modules) that
we already have. It's quite possible that there's already a module implementing your
idea and that needs your contributions!

Also, if you want to see your idea on this list, [go ahead and add it](https://github.com/nodecopter/nodecopter.com/edit/master/pages/ideas.md), everything
is welcome!

### Acurate position feedback from kinect

Watch a flying nodecopter using a kinect, allowing for a much more precise positioning system and tighter feedback loop.

### Flight recorder (and replayer)

Write all commands to a log file (or stream elsewhere) and allow replay of logs back to the copter again to repeat movements.

### Preprogram route using Logo syntax

Allow programming of a route in the Logo programming language: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language) and then replaying

### 3D representation of copter in 6 axis in webgl

Stream the gyroscope data back to a web and draw a 3d model of the copter in its real world position (tilt, rotation etc) in a web browser

### Streetview style mapping

Quite tricky, but could take snap shots from the camera and record with position, angle etc, and try to recreate an indoor streetview from them.

### Touch sensitive feelers

Attach some long feelers to all 4 corners, providing feedback when getting too close to any wall.

### Can a nodecopter fly upside down?

Is it possible to get a nodecopter to spin its rotors the other direction and fly upside down?

### stick to a wall

If rotors can be reversed, can they be used to create force to hold a nodecopter to a angled source or even a wall?

### Waltzing

Make one copter mimic another, and then have two waltz, as dancing partners

### Line Dancing

I've managed to get one copter dancing to music, why not 5 in a row?

### Attaching stuff to quadcopters

* Velco - for sticking to things and other quadcopters
* Mifi device - for much greater range over GSM/3G
* Lazers
